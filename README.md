# Genome-Analysis-VT22
As part of the course Genome Analysis I'll be analysing metagenomic and trancsriptomic data from samples from the northern Gulf of Mexico.
Here I'll be documenting my work.

Data and inspiration is from: Thrash, J.C. et al. (2017) ‘Metabolic Roles of Uncultivated Bacterioplankton Lineages in the Northern Gulf of Mexico “Dead Zone”’, mBio. Edited by M.A. Moran, 8(5), pp. e01017-17. doi:10.1128/mBio.01017-17.

You can read their paper [here](https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/mBio.01017-17).

All my scripts and some of the data for the project can be found [here](https://github.com/Jay-uu/Genome-Analysis-VT22/tree/master) (or just change to branch master on this page).

To really understand what I did and to have a look at my results I recommend you check out the [wiki](https://github.com/Jay-uu/Genome-Analysis-VT22/wiki)
