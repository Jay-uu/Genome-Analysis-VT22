# Genome-Analysis-VT22
As part of the course Genome Analysis I'll be analysing metagenomic and trancsriptomic data from samples from the northern Gulf of Mexico.
Here I'll be documenting my work.

Data and inspiration is from: Thrash, J.C. et al. (2017) ‘Metabolic Roles of Uncultivated Bacterioplankton Lineages in the Northern Gulf of Mexico “Dead Zone”’, mBio. Edited by M.A. Moran, 8(5), pp. e01017-17. doi:10.1128/mBio.01017-17.
